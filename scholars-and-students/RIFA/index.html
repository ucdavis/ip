<h3>About the Program</h3>
    <p>The Research and Innovation Fellowship for Agriculture (RIFA) offers early-career professionals enrolled in agricultural and development-oriented graduate programs at all
      University of California campuses the opportunity to plan, engage and implement two to six-month-long international projects in developing countries.</p>
    <p>RIFA Fellows collaborate with a host institution in the country they are working to develop robust projects that address global challenges in
    agriculture and food systems. Host organizations define the available opportunities and a fellow’s collaborative work contributes integrally to the success and sustainability of ongoing projects and programs.
    Faculty mentors at the University of California also play an integral role, serving as resources and helping guide Fellows in their projects.</p>
    <p>RIFA is funded primarily by the United States Agency for International Development's <a class="external-link" href="https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab">Global Development Lab</a>
      and by the University of California's <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/">Global Food Initiative</a>.</p>

    <p><h3><a name="programsus"></a>Program Sustainability</h3>

    <p>We envision the RIFA program as a challenge to our institutional development office to build an endowment that could expand and sustain this initiative.
      We will seek the opportunity to demonstrate during the next three years the importance of this program and to reach out to the private sector for support.
      To learn more see our <a title="support letter RIFA" href="/media/files/rifa/IAD_RIFA_Endowment_Flyer-10-7.pdf">support flyer</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="hosts"></a>Host Institutions</h3>

    <p>
    Hosts can be international NGOs, host country universities, research institutions, or non-US government agencies, as well as local not-for-profit development organization.</p>
    <p>Hosting of a  RIFA Fellow entails providing them with overseas project or research opportunities with a UC-affiliated organization.
    These opportunities may be well-defined, or they may identify a broadly defined
    need within the organization from which the Fellow and the organization could
    jointly develop a project plan. Projects should address a specific challenge in
    the agriculture or food systems sector. Fellowships frequently contribute to
    students’ master or doctoral work. Basic internships where the student works
    broadly within an organization are not appropriate for RIFA Fellowships</p>
