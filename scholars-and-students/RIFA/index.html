       <h3>About the Program</h3>
    <p>The Research and Innovation Fellowship for Agriculture (RIFA) offers early-career professionals enrolled in agricultural and development-oriented graduate programs at UC Davis, UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz the opportunity to plan, engage and implement two to six-month-long international projects in developing countries.</p>
    <p>RIFA Fellows collaborate with a host institution in the country they are
    working to develop robust projects that address global challenges in
    agriculture and food systems. Host organizations define the available opportunities and a fellow’s collaborative work contributes integrally to the success and sustainability of ongoing projects and programs.&nbsp;Faculty mentors at the University of California also play an integral
    role, serving as resources and helping guide Fellows in their projects.</p>
    <p>RIFA is funded primarily by the United States Agency for International Development's <a class="external-link" href="https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab">Global Development Lab</a> and by the University of California's <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/">Global Food Initiative</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="programsus"></a>Program Sustainability</h3>

    <p>We envision the RIFA program as a challenge to our institutional development office to build an endowment that could expand and sustain this initiative. We will seek the opportunity to demonstrate during the next three years the importance of this program and to reach out to the private sector for support. To learn more see our <a title="support letter RIFA" href="/media/files/rifa/IAD_RIFA_Endowment_Flyer-10-7.pdf">support flyer</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="hosts"></a>Host Institutions</h3>

    <p>
    Hosts can be international NGOs, host country universities, research institutions, or non-US government agencies, as well as local not-for-profit development organization.</p>
    <p>Hosting of a  RIFA&nbsp;Fellow entails providing them with overseas project or research opportunities with a UC-affiliated organization.
    These opportunities may be well-defined, or they may identify a broadly defined
    need within the organization from which the Fellow and the organization could
    jointly develop a project plan. Projects should address a specific challenge in
    the agriculture or food systems sector. Fellowships frequently contribute to
    students’ master or doctoral work. Basic internships where the student works
    broadly within an organization are not appropriate for RIFA Fellowships</p>

    <p>RIFA is no longer accepting host applications for 2017.&nbsp;Organizations
    interested in hosting a 2017 RIFA fellow should submit statements of
    interests&nbsp;to Elana Peach-Fine at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:%20elana.ipo@gmail.com">elana.ipo@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>Sept.
    1</strong>,&nbsp;and complete the full&nbsp;<a title="2017 RIFA Host Profile" href="/media/files/rifa/2017-RIFA-Host-Profile.pdf">Host Profile</a> by&nbsp;<strong>Sept. 19</strong>. &nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/hostopp"></a></p>

    <h3>Mentors</h3>

    <p>
    Mentors are an integral piece of the RIFA Fellowship Program. Mentors may be professors, emeriti, or non-faculty academics affiliated with the University of California. Mentors will work with students to create their implementation plans, build connections with their partners and follow their progress throughout the project cycle.</p>
