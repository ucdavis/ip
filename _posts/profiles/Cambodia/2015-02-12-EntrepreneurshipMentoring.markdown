Safe vegetables promote health, as they are typically free from chemical and microbiological hazards. A safe vegetable value chain (SVVC) includes all of the linked market actors, extending from input providers to local farmers to marketers selling to consumers who seek safe vegetables as part of their routine diet. The USAID project funded by the Horticulture Innovation Lab, “Innovations to build and scale safe vegetable value chains in Cambodia,” aims to strengthen dynamic elements within Cambodian value chain linkages, resulting in improved safe vegetable production and postharvest practices through distribution of products to consumers.

One of the main components of this project is to provide mentoring support to entrepreneurs and value chain participants. Building the Cambodian SVVC is more than just introducing potential partners and technologies—it requires building social capital and developing trusted working relationships. The project approach aims to empower local people to become leaders and teachers within their communities and businesses, placing a significant effort on facilitating relationships to develop solutions that function at multiple stakeholder levels within existing local systems.

In February 2017, faculty members from Royal University of Agriculture (RUA), University of Battambang (UBB) and University of California at Davis (UC Davis) held a Partnering Workshop in Battambang to initial project planning activities with value chain stakeholders, including farmers and vegetable producers, input suppliers, vegetable marketers and shippers, and supporters of the safe vegetable value chain from the Cambodian Department of Agriculture and associated non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The workshop covered:
- Introduction to the project, including objectives of the workshop and field tours
- Activities and farmer-led trainings to make interaction between all SVVC stake holders
- Gathering information to identify SVVC priorities and challenges
- Methodology of Focus Group Discussions, SWOT analysis, and farmer-to-farmer training
- Preliminary review of results and way forward

Aside from the focus group discussions, workshop participants also took part in market tours to assess how vegetables were currently distributed and sold, as well as field tours of participating farmers who demonstrated adopted technologies and techniques. Throughout these events, faculty members from the three partnering universities supported each other by providing recommendations on how to conduct workshop discussions, economic analyses, and market surveys.

The participatory events of this partnering workshop produced volumes of useful information that detail the foundation, focus, and rationale for the current SVVC. Particularly, this workshop gathered information about the current SVVC situation by facilitating interaction between all value chain participants.
