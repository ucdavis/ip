Katie von der Lieth is a master’s student in International Agricultural Development at UC Davis and a RIFA Amazon Biodiversity Fellow in Brazil. She is working at IDESAM, Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon, on a project aimed at scaling up coffee agroforestry production in Apui – a large town in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Katie’s specific objectives are to make a cost-benefit analysis of coffee agroforestry systems and a business plan for attracting invest for them.<br>

In her first month in Brazil, Katie spent most of her time in Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas, reviewing and analyzing the mountains of data already collected by IDESAM’s coffee agroforestry project.  With data ranging from the farm to policy level, she identified the areas where the ideal benefits of coffee agroforestry weren’t being met, and then created a survey instrument to address and question these gaps. It was a challenge to develop a survey that built on such much previous data and it was even more challenging to identify and reach out to farmers outside the project. <br>

Katie then traveled to Apui, surrounded by the Amazon Rainforest, to begin field interviews with the assistance of the IDESAM Apui office staff. Due to the lack of telephone service and the significant travel time between farms, conducting interviews was a difficult – but predicted – challenge. Katie tied to maximize her time by scheduling interviews with small groups of farmers while in the field, instead of individual interviews on different farms. So far she has completed twelve of her twenty targeted interviews with farmers. Once back in Apui, she will also interview other coffee market chain actors. When interviews are complete Katie will draft a business plan and work with potential investors to create a successful model for attracting capital for this niche coffee value chain. <br>

When she isn’t hard at work on the coffee grind, Katie has enjoyed sampling the local cuisine, exploring Manuas’s live music scene and working with amazing farmers in the Amazon. The best thing she’s eaten in Brazil is jackfruit and Tambaqui de banda. Tamabaqui is a freshwater fish from the Amazon River that is served grilled and accompanies with lots of lime, rice, beans and farofa (roasted manioc flour). In Manaus, a city of two million, there is free music downtown every Wednesday, concerts on the weekend and even bands in many of the large stores and restaurants. Katie’s favorite thing about life in Apui is the Amazon rainforest, always lush and alive right beyond the farms and the deforested areas. And perhaps one of Katie's most memorable experiences was visiting a farmer whose property abutted a national park who was adamant that she “tell America” that not all farmers living in the Amazon want to destroy it, and that some farmers like himself preserve more than they are legally obligated because they value the rainforest so much. <br>
