Susan Johnson grew-up in Davis and in 1994 began working for UC Davis’ Small Ruminant Collaborative Research Support Program (SR-CRSP). She coordinated and helped redesign the CRSP which led to the creation of the Global Livestock Collaborative Research Support Program (GL-CRSP) in 1997. Johnson served as Associate Director for Planning and Strategic Development at the Global Livestock CRSP with responsibility for project monitoring, evaluation and support, development of new initiatives, and knowledge management and capacity building programs. In 2004, Johnson was part of the collaboration with Dr. Borlaug, Texas A&M, USDA, USAID and CIMMYT that created and designed the Norman E. Borlaug LEAP Fellowships. 

Johnson has an MA in International Administration and Intercultural Management from the School for International Training in Brattleboro, Vermont and a BA in German from California State University, Fullerton.

Prior to returning to Davis in 1994, Johnson lived abroad in Europe and Central America. Johnson studied at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg Germany, the Université de Paris – Sorbonne and Le Cordon Bleu, Paris. While in Czechoslovakia, Johnson helped develop and design the first national language school to privatize.
