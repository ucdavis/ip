<p>Randy Southard is a UC Davis professor of soils. His research group studies the processes of soil formation, how those processes cause soil properties to vary across the landscape, and how soil properties affect soil management. Southard currently studies the influence of soil properties and management on agricultural dust production in the Central Valley; fixation of potassium by soil minerals; soil carbon-mineralogy interactions in forested ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada; and mineral alteration processes in California, Hawaii and Iceland.</p>
