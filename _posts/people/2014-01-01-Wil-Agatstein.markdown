Sadly Wil passed away unexpectedly Monday, June 24 (2013). Wil Agatstein was a key member of our e-Afghan Ag project - an initiative providing credible, relevant information to those helping farmers in Afghanistan. His insights into business and into the world of modern communication technologies were foundational to our success.

Wil wore two hats - one, in IPO, as as a "agronomist in training" and one as Director of the Entrepreneurship Academy. For the latter, Wil shared a passion with the Child Family Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for bringing innovative ideas to market. He believed in the power of technology to make the world a better place through economic development, education and allowing people to understand their culture in the context of modernity. As Executive Director, he strengthened the Institute's focus--and networks--on building and launching sustainable businesses that solve real world problems.

Prior to 2008, Agatstein was Vice President at Intel and the head of Intel's Emerging Markets Group. He had nearly three decades of global experience in the competitive high-tech arena. During his 27 years at Intel, Agatstein established a proven track record of innovation of production products, including the start-up of Intel's chip design center in Malaysia and the Intel Powered classmate PC (CMPC)--a small, rugged and personalized laptop for children in the developing world. Wil brought this energy and enthusiasm to IPO providing key input for its various information communication technology (ICT) projects.

Wil served as a board member of Inveneo. When he was not busy at IPO and at the Institute, Wil was an avid bicycle rider/snow boarder and amateur photographer and was always looking for people to join him on an adventure. We miss him dearly.
