Alyson has been with UC Davis as a temporary administrative assistant since October of 2017. She joined the International Programs Office team in June of 2018, where she completes administrative tasks, as well as international program coordination. Mrs. Malcolm's administrative background has allowed her to provide effective assistance to numerous managers in various office settings. Though this job assignment is temporary, she hopes to gain a permanent position with the International Programs Office, where she considers her colleagues and office a "home away from home".
