Dr. Hopmansâ€™ tenure with the UC Davis began in 1988 when he accepted a faculty position with the department of Land, Air, and Water Resources. His research and teaching activities focus on the development of experimental and mathematical methods to better understand the fundamental processes controlling soil water flow and transport in the vadose zone across spatial scales, and include interests in pore-scale processes, soil water-plant relationships, irrigation water and nutrient management, and climate change impacts on California hydrology. He has about 170 peer-reviewed publications in soil science and water resources journals.
