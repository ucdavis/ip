Andra Williams joined the Borlaug LEAP program as the Student Affairs Officer in January 2015.  Prior to that, she received her degree in French and a Minor in Community Nutrition from UC Davis and spent a year and a half as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Senegal.  She is excited to be a part of such an exciting program and looks forward to being a part of the International Programs Office.  In her spare time, she loves to cook and would be happy to whip up some cookies if you ask nicely!
