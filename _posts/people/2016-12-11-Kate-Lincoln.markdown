Born and raised in rural Nebraska, Kate Lincoln has had a life-long interest in agriculture systems. Her first commercial plane flight at age 20 landed her in Australia on a six-month exchange program which ignited her interest in the world community. After earning her BS in Agriculture and Natural Resources from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln entered the Masters International Peace Corps Program at Michigan Technological University. She completed her masters research in Panama while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in agriculture, earning her MS of International Agro-Forestry. Lincoln lived and worked on the US Virgin Island of St. Croix for many years, first as a Research Scientist at the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of the Virgin Islands, then as manager of the islandâ€™s first certified organic farm, and also as the Virgin Islands Urban and Community Forestry Coordinator with the VI Department of Agriculture. Lincoln worked on a team that conducted a comprehensive street tree inventory and assessment for all of St. Croix, and wrote the Virgin Islands Heritage Tree Law.

Joining the IPO team in 2016, Lincoln serves as the senior writer on the team, primarily responsible for grant proposal development. She collaborates with many UCD and external partners,  providing comprehensive and innovative project initiation skills to bring international development projects to fruition.
