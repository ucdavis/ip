With more than ten years of international development experience focused in Latin America and East Africa, Nikki works largely on projects centered around public health, education, and agriculture. She is especially interested in capacity building at the community level, employing multidisciplinary techniques to address community-identified needs. Using her talents of leadership and training, Nikki has managed many projects intended to grow communities both in and outside of the US; she led a project in Rwanda to help a womenâ€™s group open their own successful business, then established a training and mentoring program to ensure its sustainability. Nikki also co-manages the Humphrey Fellowship Program at UC Davis, providing program planning and management, academic and professional development training and mentoring for professionals from developing and emerging economies.
