The target beneficiaries of the $20 million project grant from USAID are Afghan government extension workers. AAEP II activities will operate from five key provinces, Kabul, Nangarhar, Herat, Balkh and Parwan, and eventually engage DAILs from up to 25 different provinces. AAEP II uses the same extension model employed by the first phase (AAEP I) which includes:

* Training Workshops;

* Thematic Workgroups;

* Provincial Model Teaching Farms (PMTFs);

* Farmer Field Schools (FFSs);

* Farmer Field Demonstrations (FFDs); and

* Mini-Fund Projects.

By empowering Afghan extension workers to transfer useful information and technology to farmers, the desired project impacts of improved rural household food security and income generation, and improved nutritional status of farm households, can be achieved.
