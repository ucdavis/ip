The second phase of the Afghanistan Agricultural Extesion Project (AAEP II) builds the technical and teaching capacity of Afghanistan's Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) to deliver effective and sustainable extension services to Afghan farmers. Since 2014, AAEP II has supported over 2,000 on-farm training sessions, helping extension workers reach over 14,000 farmers.

The target beneficiaries of the $20 million project grant from USAID are Afghan government extension workers, who learn how to effectively identify farming problems and training needs. AAEP II activities operate from five key provinces (Kabul, Nangarhar, Herat, Balkh and Parwan) and engage DAILs from up to 25 different provinces. AAEP II uses the same extension model employed by the first phase (AAEP I), which includes:

* Training Workshops;

* Thematic Workgroups;

* Provincial Model Teaching Farms (PMTFs);

* Farmer Field Schools (FFSs);

* Farmer Field Demonstrations (FFDs); and

* Mini-Fund Projects.

By empowering Afghan extension workers to transfer useful information and technology to farmers, improved rural household food security, additional income generation, and improved nutritional status of farm households can be achieved.

<i>This project is made possible by the United States Agency for International Development and the generous support from the American People.</i>
