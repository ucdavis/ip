Globally, women make up approximately 43% of the agricultural labor force and typically bear more burden than men, as they are responsible for both field chores and household duties. However, most developing country extension systems neglect to address the needs of female farmers or rural workers.

INGENAES helps to build robust extension advisory services capable of assessing and responding to the needs of both men and women farmers. INGENAES team members work with USAID missions, civil society organizations, farmer organizations, universities, and private sector service providers in Feed The Future countries on action-oriented training, learning exchanges, and mentoring programs to promote gender-transformative agricultural development and nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices.
