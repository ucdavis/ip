UC Davis is working with USAID and Global Communities to complete a mid-term evaluation of the USAID Resiliency
in Northern Ghana Project (RING). RING is a poverty reduction program designed to improve the nutrition and livelihood
status of vulnerable households in an integrated fashion. RING applies a multidisciplinary approach to increase the resiliency of these
households through agriculture, income generation, savings and loans, nutrition, WASH, and
governance interventions. Through these interventions, the project aims to improve the lives of
women, namely by decreasing their time burden, increasing their control over household
income, and increasing their social capital, thereby creating more resilient families.
