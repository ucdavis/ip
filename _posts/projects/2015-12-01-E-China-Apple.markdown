##Afghan Ski Club

You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your â€¨own world.

That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
