The $10 million, five-year agriculture program, will enable faculty and graduate student exchanges and facilitate joint research between the universities. It will provide technical and curricular-reform assistance to UAF and will build the capacity of Pakistani agriculture to meet the country's food-security, economic and employment needs.
