The U.S.-Pakistan Centers for Advanced Studies (USPCAS) have been designed by the United States Government and the Government of Pakistan to support Pakistan's economic development by strengthening universities and encouraging applied research. UC Davis has partnered with University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) to manage the U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food Security, which is educating the next generation of scientists, engineers, and policy makers through innovative academic programs. The five-year agriculture program enables faculty and graduate student exchanges, facilitates joint research between the universities, provides technical and curricular-reform assistance, and aims to build the capacity of Pakistani agriculture to meet the country's food-security, economic and employment needs.
