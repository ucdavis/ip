For the past 30 years the Iwate Agricultural Junior College(IAJC) has sent their students to UC Davis and California for a one week technical Field Program.  In recent years, IAJC has sent the entire Senior Class (approximately 60 students) to Davis for one week. The students stay in the dorms and make one day Technical Field Trips to various sites in and around the Northern California.  The purpose of their visit is to acquaint them with a variety of Agricultural Operations found in California as well as the activities of the University of California, Davis and the University of California Cooperative Extension. <br>
