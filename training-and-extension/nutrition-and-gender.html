<p class="lead">Helping extension and advisory services deliver improved technical assistance and smallholder farmer support.</p>
    <p>Agricultural extension and advisory services (AEAS) support smallholders in improving their livelihoods by facilitating their access to inputs,
      market opportunities, and the skills and knowledge to become more effective farmers. AEAS can play a key role improving gender equity and increasing
      the availability of diverse, nutritious foods given their ability to influence the production decisions of farming households. By challenging mindsets
      that fail to consider the needs of both women and men farmers, CAES IPO supports AEAS in inspiring inclusive, diverse agricultural production. CAES IPO leverages
      its technical assistance and research capabilities to support local experts familiar with their contexts in identifying and implementing strategies to
      empower all farmers, and to make nutritious foods more available both within farming households and in local food systems.

<p><b>Singing the same song: Nutrition-sensitive agriculture messages in Zambia</b><br>
<i>Published in Nutrition Exchange, Issue #8 (July 2017)</i><br>
<a target= "_blank" href="http://www.ennonline.net/singingthesamesongnutritionsensitiveagriculturemessagesinzambia" target="_blank">Article available at ennonline.net</a><br>
<a target= "_blank" href="http://www.ennonline.net/mediahub/nutritionsensitiveagzambia">Podcast interview with authors Edye Kuyper and Bertha Munthali at ENN's MediaHub</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Zambia has experienced more than a decade of robust economic growth and stable maize production,
yet food and nutrition security has not improved significantly. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture works to maximise agriculture’s
contribution to improved nutrition and offers promise for improving the dietary diversity of Zambians. In Zambia, INGENAES worked with partners
to prioritise the harmonisation of  nutrition messages, collaborating closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to develop nutrition-sensitive agricultural messages for the government’s 1,700 camp extension officers.<p>


<p><b>Dietary Gap Assessment: an approach for evaluating whether a country's food supply can support health diets at the population level</b><br>
<i>Published online in Public Health Nutrition (June 2017)</i><br>
<a target= "_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980017001173" target="_blank">Article available at Cambridge University Press</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Dietary diversity, and in particular consumption of nutrient-rich foods including fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and animal-source foods,
is linked to greater nutrient adequacy. We developed a ‘dietary gap assessment’ to evaluate the degree to which a nation’s food supply could support healthy
diets at the population level.<p>


<p><b>Agriculture extension and advisory services: Frontline Contributors to the Nutrition Decade</b><br>
<i>Published by the United National System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN), News Issue #42 (May 2017)</i><br>
<a target= "_blank" href="/media/files/nutrition-gender/UNSCN-News-42_Kuyper_Schneider_AEAS_nutrition.pdf">Article available to download as PDF</a><br>
<b>Summary:</b> There is growing interest in better leveraging agricultural extension and advisory services (AEAS) for nutrition-sensitive agriculture.
Discussions related to nutrition-sensitive agriculture have at times considered agriculture in the absence of the market forces to which it responds.
This paper outlines opportunities for AEAS to continue their vital role in supporting the production decisions of farming households, while calling attention
to incentives that may facilitate AEAS contributions to nutrition. </p>
