<b>Abstratc:</b> Zambia has experienced more than a decade of robust economic growth and stable maize production,
yet food and nutrition security has not improved significantly. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture works to maximise agriculture’s
contribution to improved nutrition and offers promise for improving the dietary diversity of Zambians. In Zambia, INGENAES worked with partners
to prioritise the harmonisation of  nutrition messages, collaborating closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to develop nutrition-sensitive agricultural messages for the government’s 1,700 camp extension officers. <br>


<b>Dietary Gap Assessment: an approach for evaluating whether a country's food supply can support health diets at the population level</b><br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980017001173">Article available at Cambridge University Press</a><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Dietary diversity, and in particular consumption of nutrient-rich foods including fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and animal-source foods,
is linked to greater nutrient adequacy. We developed a ‘dietary gap assessment’ to evaluate the degree to which a nation’s food supply could support healthy
diets at the population level. <br>
