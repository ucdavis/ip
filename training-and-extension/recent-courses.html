<p class="lead">The CA&amp;ES International Programs Office (IPO) conducts courses and workshops both in-country and on campus.
  UC Davis is engaged in a range of topics from animal science to staple food crops. However, regular themes relate to high-value crops, market development and extension.
  Recent courses are shown below. Notes: All California courses have Technical Field Programs -
  demonstrating linkages between research, extension, education and industry, and involve the development of action plans for implementation
  upon finishing the course.</p>

        methods were addressed as the backbone of sustained agricultural productivity.&nbsp; The pros and cons of various irrigation technologies were presented, as well as innovations for improving crop yield and quality via water management. Strategies
        for challenging circumstances i.e. arid climates, drought, salinization, etc. were discussed.&nbsp; Finally, participants worked together to analyze their own countries’ water management systems and propose feasible improvements. The majority
        of the course occurred outside the classroom, which gave participants first-hand experience with some of the most advanced and diverse agricultural water management systems in the world. Participants learned from various key players in U.S. agriculture,
        including researchers, extension agents, professors, government officials, suppliers, and farmers. <strong>Lead instructor: Corky Lovin.</strong>
