As part of the collaboration between UC Davis-Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT), a workshop was held at TUAT for TUAT students outlining how universities can help address the many major global challenges through the combination of education, research and outreach. The international Programs Office (IPO) of UC Davis plays a special role by helping build bridges between the potentially useful research that happens at the university to those who can benefit in developing countries. With a focus on extension and high value crops, IPO works with national partners to build capacity and provide technical information that can help. <br/> Key contact: <a href="mailto:mozbell@ucdavis.edu">Mark Bell</a></p>
